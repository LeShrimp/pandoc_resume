The Markdown Resume
===================

My Resume as of 2016 in Markdown format.

Thanks to [Mark Szepieniec](https://github.com/mszep/)
for allowing me to finally have my Resume in an easily
editable and distributable format!

And it looks good, too!

Simply run `make` to convert the *resume.md* to
html, docx, rtf and pdf format.
