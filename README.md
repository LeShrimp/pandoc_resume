The Markdown Resume
===================

My Resume as of 2016 in Markdown format.

Thanks to [Christophe-Marie Duquesne](http://blog.chmd.fr/editing-a-cv-in-markdown-with-pandoc.html)
and [Mark Szepieniec](https://github.com/mszep/pandoc_resume)
for allowing me to finally have my Resume in an easily
editable and distributable format!

And it looks good, too!

Simply run `make` to convert the *resume.md* to
html, docx, rtf and pdf format.
